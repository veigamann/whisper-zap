# whisper-zap

whisper-zap transcribes audio messages using the `whisper-v3-large` via the [Groq](https://www.groq.com/) API and manages user access through a whitelist system. I've written the basic gist of it myself and used Claude 3.5 Sonnet along with Github Copilot to write the boring parts like CRUD operations and command parsing and handling.

I've written this in an hour or so, so it's not perfect, may be very broken, and lacks a lot of features, but it works for me. Also, UX is not a priority here, so don't expect fancy prompts or logs.

I'm sharing it here in case someone finds it useful or wants to contribute to it. I'm not actively maintaining it, but I'll try to help if you have any questions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is just a proof of concept and not intended for production use or deployment without further development and security considerations.

I didn't bother adding JS/TS build steps, I'm just running it under the hood directly with `tsx` (script in `package.json`). Using `bun` purely as a package manager.

## üöÄ Features

- Transcribe audio messages in WhatsApp chats
- User whitelist management
- Admin commands for bot configuration

- Reaction feedback for message processing status
